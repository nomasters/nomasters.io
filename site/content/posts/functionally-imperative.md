I'm excited to share that I've released my first video ["cgi-bin, ftw (part 1)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyN1upBxbMw) for a new project I've started called: [functionally imperative](https://funcimp.biz/).

I've had a lot of little project ideas floating around in my head for a while. Over the last few months I've been working with [Better Together](https://bettertogether.group/) to dive in deeper and help me reach clarity on my goals and my process for accomlishing these goals.

Expect to see more writing here as well: I just finished reading Seth Godin's [The Practice](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53479927-the-practice) (highly recommended). It has inspired me to commit to the practice of creation again.
