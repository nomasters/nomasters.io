I'm excited to share that I've released my first video ["cgi-bin, ftw (part 1)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyN1upBxbMw) for a new project I've started called: [functionally imperative](https://funcimp.biz/).

Over the last few months I've been working with [Better Together](https://bettertogether.group/) to help me sort through how I'm setting goals and working towards creative work that I've had sitting in the back of my mind. With the effort I've put into that with the wonderful folks there, its been wornderful to work through the process of creation.

Expect to see more writing here as well. I just finished reading Seth Godin's [The Practice](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53479927-the-practice) (highly recommended), and its inspired me to commit to the practice of creation.
