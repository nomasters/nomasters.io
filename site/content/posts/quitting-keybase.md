It's long overdue, but I'm quitting [keybase](https://keybase.io/) and deleting my account. After the TLS issues today, it was a stark reminder that the [Zoom aquasition](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/) effectively killed keybase [long ago](https://github.com/keybase/client/graphs/contributors).

[https://keybase.io/rjrbt](https://keybase.io/rjrbt) is no more.

If you are interested in communicating with me, you can find an email address to kick off communication at [https://n.2p5.xyz/](https://n.2p5.xyz/). I've also got a [signal](https://signal.org/en/) account, but you'll have to ask for that number :)
