# TODOS

I'd like to revamp this to be built from the ground up with a layout engine I write.


- [] strip the template down to the bare minimum
- [] do I actually understand how hugo templates work? Maybe I should sort that out?
- [] maybe I should just use a template that exists (but is that fun?)
- [] maybe write on this some more
