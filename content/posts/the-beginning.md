The purpose of this project is to capture my [thoughts](/) and [work](https://github.com/nomasters) on a journey towards living in accordance to a set of [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) revolving around [freethought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought), [skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism), and [libertarian socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism).

Because of my [work as a technologist](https://n.2p5.xyz/), this project will tend to cover topics that are technical in nature, but also explore guiding principles as they relate to the focus of this project.
